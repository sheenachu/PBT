CMSC 122 Winter 2016 Final Project

Chicagoin' Green

by Kevin Bernat, Estelle Ostro, and Sheena Chu

Project set up instructions:

    Modules:
        django
        json
        traceback
        io
        sys
        csv
        os
        operator
        meep (local)
        functools
        rankings (local)
        coc_data (local)
        coords_to_block (local)

Structure of Code:

    Data is collected in csv files and in sqlite3 databases. This data is then organized and analyzed and then used to generated a map of Chicago. This map of Chicago, along with the data generated in sqlite3 databases, are placed in a website which is created with Django.

Project Files:
    Note1: For each file, the following categories will be given based on how much the code is original, modified, or a direct copy:
        Direct Copy - File was unchanged from source.

        Modified - File was changed for the purpose of the project,
        but the original structure is maintained.

        Original - File was written independently or heavily modified from source. 

    Note2: Code that was generated but ended up not being used for the final project will be labelled as "Legacy Code". Code that is needed for the final project will not have this label.       

    Data Files (Kevin Bernat):

        CSV Files:

            census_energy_data_elec.csv: Electricity usage based on     census block.

            census_energy_Data_therms.csv: Gas usage based on census block.

            Energy_Usage_2010.csv: Imported and complete data from City of Chicago website (both electricity and gas).

            Energy_Usage_2010_elec.csv: Electricity data from City of Chicago website.

            Energy_Usage_2010_therms.csv: Gas data from City of Chicago website.

            Energy_Usage_2010_mini.csv: Used to test Python files.

            standby.csv: Data on the standby power that certain electrical appliances use under different conditions.

            gas_improvements.csv: Data on the energy and money saved if certain devices are used less.

        Sqlite3 Databases:

            coc.db: Legacy Code - Data from City of Chicago Website (Energy Usage 2010). This was created by using "Energy_Usage_2010.csv" and using the following command-line prompt commands:
            .separator "," .import Energy_Usage_2010.csv electricity/therms

            improvements.db: Database with two tables. One called standby which has information on standby power for electrical devices. The other is called therms_improvements which has information on gas energy and money saved for certain appliances. This was created by using "standby.csv" and "gas_improvements.csv" and .separator "," .import csv_filename table in the sqlite3 command line.

        Python Files:

            coc_data.py: Original - Organizes data based on census block and neighborhoods (community areas)

            coords_to_block.py: Original - Converts an address to a census block.

            nrel_data.py: Modified - Gets information about alternative fuel stations in Chicago. The distance function was retrieved from online, but the rest is original.

            nrel_pv_data.py: Original - Gets information on energy generated by placing photovoltaic devices at a given location.

            nrel_rates.py: Original - Gives the electricity rates in $/kwh.

            quicksort.py: Modified - Sorts a list from least to greatest using a median of three quicksort algorithm.

            rankings.py: Original - Ranks the neighborhoods or census block based on energy efficiency.

            standby_crawler.py: Original - Crawls the Standby Power website

            utility.py: Direct Copy -Used to get and read requests from urls.

        
    Django Files:
    
    Map Files (Estelle Ostro):

        Python Files:

            rank_neighborhoods.py: Original - Used to add ranking info to 
            geojson properties.

            map/views.py: Modified - Creates a Django form which retrieves 
            the census tract of a submitted address.

            search/views.py: (with Sheena Chu) Modified - Creates a Django form which retrieves the amount saved/month for a given device 
            and number of hours/day

        GEOJSON Files:

            Boundaries - Community Areas (current).geojson: Community area
            boundaries from City of Chicago website

            Boundaries - Neighborhoods.geojson: Neighborhood boundaries from 
            City of Chicago website

            censusRanked.geojson: Census tract boundaries with ranking 
            information added.

            chicagoCensus.geojson: Census tract boundaries from City of 
            Chicago website.

            ranked_neighborhoods2.geojson: Community Area boundaries with
            ranking information added.

        HTML Files:

            energymap.html: (Legacy) Modified - used to experiment with mapmaking techniques

            map/census.html: Modified - To display a choropleth map of census 
            tracts with a census tract lookup by address function using the 
            JS library Leaflet (leafletjs.com)

            map/map.html: Modified - To display a choropleth map of 
            neighborhoods using the JS library Leaflet (leafletjs.com)

        JS Files:

            community-areas.js: Stores community area boundaries in a js
            variable.

            census-tracts.js: Stroes census tract boundaries in a js
            variable.

            maptest1.js: (Legacy) Stores sample map data in a js variable.
